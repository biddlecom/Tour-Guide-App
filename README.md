### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting a certain city.  I chose to to make a tour guide app for Rome, Italy.

<br/>

The app lists:

-The top 24 places to visit <br/>
-12 restaurants to try <br/>
-15 great hotels to stay in <br/>
-10 tours to attend <br/>

<br/>

The app also contains all the useful information a traveler would need to know including:

-Each place to visit lists an address, phone number, hours of operation and a short description of the place. <br/>
-Each restaurant suggestion lists an address, phone number, hours of operation and a short description about the restaurant. <br/>
-Each hotel suggestion lists an address, phone number, website and a short description about the hotel. <br/>
-Each tour lists a duration, cost, website and a short description about the tour. <br/>
